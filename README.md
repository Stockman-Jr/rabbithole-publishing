## UX

### Site Purpose
To provide information about Rabbithole as a company, what they can offer developers and show off previously published games.

### Site Goal
Build a sense of trust for the company to encourage indie game developers to apply for partnership and update visitors on what games are being developed.

### Audience
The main target audience is indie game developers, but everyone with a love for videogames would be a benefitial audience.


### User Goals

## Design

### Colour scheme
![Colour Palette](assets/readme-images/colour_scheme.png)

This colour scheme, with the addition of black and white, was created and used with the intention of providing as much contrast as possible. It is somewhat based on the colours in the background image of the header and games section, but I selected darker colours since the original image was too bright. Hence why I created a gradient overlay effect on those images.

### Typography
Two fonts were taken from Google Fonts and used throughout the site.
Berkshire Swash was applied h1 headings because I wanted something abit 'fairytaley' to go with the company name. Fredoka was used for the rest of the content, with sans-serif as backup font.

### Imagery
Half of the images on this site was sourced from free stock photo platforms.
The rest was sourced from some incredibly talented artists, all of which will be credited in this document. The background image of the header section was reused in the games section, except I turned it upside down for a subtle, cheeky reference to 'Down the Rabbithole'. The logo was created by me in Procreate.

## Features

### Existing Features

#### Navigation bar:
Included on both pages, allows user to easily navigate between all sections on the 'Home' page and 'Apply' page. All links also has a hover effect.

![Navigation Bar](assets/readme-images/navigation.png)
  

#### The Landing Page:

![Landing Page](assets/readme-images/landing_page.png)

  * Is the header section of the site, included on both pages.
  * Features the navigation bar, background image, logo, company name and an introduction to Rabbithole.
  * Purpose of this landing page is to immediately inform the user what Rabbithole is all about. I used an animation for the logo to draw the eyes to the middle of the screen where the information is provided.

#### About Section
  * This section provides some more info about the company divided into two parts: what they're looking for and what they can provide for potential partners. It also includes a button that can take you directly to the application page.

  ![About Section](assets/readme-images/about_section.png)

#### Games Section
  * Consists of cards displaying what games has been created or what's being developed in partnership with Rabbithole.

![Games Section](assets/readme-images/games_section.png)

  * The cards features a small preview of concept art, game title, short game description and name of developer.
    * The intention of this section is to provide more trust for Rabbithole as an already established publishing company.
      The user gets to see what games has been published and is being developed together with Rabbithole, which hopefully drives in more business.

#### Apply Page:
  * This page features a form for developers to send in an application for their game.
The form is divided into two sections with h3 headings in the same style as the h2 headings in the about section - Introduction and Game Information.

![Apply Page](assets/readme-images/form_intro.png) 
![Apply Page](assets/readme-images/form_gameinfo.png) 

* Proof form working correctly:

![Submit Form](assets/readme-images/form_submit.png)



#### The Footer: 
  * Includes a heading and social media links, which all opens up in a new tab when clicked.
  ![The Footer](assets/readme-images/footer.png)
    * The text "Project created for educational purposes only" was added because some of the images in the card section was sourced from talented artists, and I do not have the rights to them. These images will be credited and links to their art portfolios will be provided in this document.




### Future Features
  * Collapsed menu for smaller screens
    * Add a function that would take user to top of the screen

If Rabbithole wasn't a fictional company, I'd add features like:
  * Make the cards in games section actual links that would take the user to another page with more details and updates about the games, or an actual game website.
    * A blog, or a newsfeed of some sort.
