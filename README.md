## UX

### Site Purpose
To provide information about Rabbithole and what they can offer developers.

### Site Goal
Build a sense of trust for the company to encourage indie game developers to apply and update visitors on what games are being developed.

### Audience
The main target audience is indie game developers, but everyone with a love for videogames would be a benefitial audience for this site as it could create more traction for upcoming and released games and increase playerbase for the games.

## Design

### Colour scheme
![Colour Palette](assets/readme-images/colour_scheme.png)

This colour scheme, with the addition of black and white, was created and used with the intention of providing as much contrast as possible. It is somewhat based on the colours in the background image of the header and games section, but I selected darker colours since the original image was too bright. Hence why I created a gradient overlay effect on those images.

### Typography
Two fonts were taken from Google Fonts and used throughout the site.
Berkshire Swash was applied h1 headings because I wanted something abit 'fairytaley' to go with the company name. Fredoka was used for the rest of the content, with sans-serif as backup font.

### Imagery
Half of the images of this site was sourced from free stock photo platforms.
The rest was sourced from some incredibly talented artists, all of which will be credited in this document. The background image of the Header section was reused in the Games section, except I turned it upside down for a subtle, cheeky reference to 'Down the Rabbithole'.
